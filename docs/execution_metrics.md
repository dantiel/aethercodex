# ðŸŽ¯ Execution Metrics Feature

## Overview

The Execution Metrics feature adds comprehensive timing and tool call tracking to oracle operations, providing valuable insights into performance and execution patterns.

## Features Added

### 1. **Real-time Execution Time Tracking**
- Tracks total execution time for both divination and conjuration operations
- Provides millisecond precision timing
- Integrated into response payloads and logging

### 2. **Tool Call Counting**
- Counts the number of tools executed during oracle operations
- Distinguishes between divination (tool-heavy) and conjuration (reasoning-focused) patterns
- Integrated into response metrics

### 3. **Enhanced Mnemosyne Recording**
- When `params[:record]` is true, execution metrics are stored alongside answers
- JSON-formatted records include timing, tool counts, and timestamps
- Backward compatible with existing recording system

### 4. **Improved User Feedback**
- Enhanced completion messages showing execution time and tool counts
- Real-time progress updates with performance metrics

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### `Support/oracle/aetherflux.rb`

**Divination Method (`channel_oracle_divination`):**
- Added `start_time` tracking at method entry
- Enhanced response with `execution_time` and `tool_call_count` fields
- Improved recording with execution metrics

**Conjuration Method (`channel_oracle_conjuration`):**
- Added `start_time` tracking at method entry  
- Enhanced response with `execution_time` and `tool_call_count` fields
- Robust `ensure` block for reliable metric recording even during errors

### Response Structure Changes

**Before:**
```ruby
{
  status: :success,
  response: {
    answer: "...",
    html: "...",
    # ... other fields
  }
}
```

**After:**
```ruby
{
  status: :success,
  response: {
    answer: "...",
    html: "...",
    execution_time: 2.345,  # seconds
    tool_call_count: 5,     # number of tools executed
    # ... other fields
  }
}
```

### Recording Format

When `params[:record]` is enabled, Mnemosyne now stores:

```json
{
  "answer": "Oracle response content",
  "execution_time": 2.345,
  "tool_call_count": 5,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23 20:22:37 +0800"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Accessing Metrics in Response
```ruby
result = Aetherflux.channel_oracle_divination(params, tools: tools)
if result[:status] == :success
  response = result[:response]
  puts "Execution time: #{response[:execution_time]}s"
  puts "Tools called: #{response[:tool_call_count]}"
end
```

### 2. Recording with Metrics
```ruby
params = {
  prompt: "Analyze this code",
  record: true  # Enable metric recording
}

result = Aetherflux.channel_oracle_divination(params, tools: tools)
# Metrics automatically recorded to Mnemosyne
```

### 3. Error Handling with Metrics
```ruby
begin
  result = Aetherflux.channel_oracle_conjuration(params, tools: tools)
rescue => e
  # Even during errors, execution time is captured
  puts "Operation failed after #{result[:response][:execution_time]}s"
end
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track oracle operation efficiency
2. **Debugging Aid**: Identify slow operations or excessive tool usage
3. **Resource Optimization**: Understand computational patterns
4. **User Experience**: Provide feedback on operation duration
5. **Analytics**: Collect data for system optimization

## Testing

Run the simple test to verify functionality:
```bash
cd Support && ruby test_metrics_simple.rb
```

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing API calls continue to work unchanged
- New fields are optional additions to responses
- Recording format maintains compatibility with existing entries
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Individual tool execution timing
- Memory usage tracking
- Token count metrics
- Performance benchmarking
- Historical trend analysis
