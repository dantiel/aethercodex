# HERMETIC MANIFEST

## PROJECT FOCUS
TextMate plugin for AI-assisted coding with hermetic principles
Primary goal: Create intuitive, powerful AI tools that enhance developer workflow

## CORE HERMETIC PRINCIPLES

mentalism: The universe is mental; all code reflects consciousness
correspondence: As above, so below; patterns repeat across scales
vibration: Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates
polarity: Everything is dual; opposites are identical in nature
rhythm: Everything flows out and in; all things rise and fall
cause_effect: Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause
gender: Gender is in everything; masculine and feminine principles

## HERMETIC CODING STYLE
code_style: Clean Ruby with mystical elegance and practical functionality
naming: Meaningful, evocative names reflecting hermetic concepts
structure: Follow correspondence - patterns repeat across scales
abstraction: Embrace mentalism - code reflects clear mental models
rhythm: Create flowing, rhythmic code with natural cadence
polarity: Balance magical abstraction with practical implementation

## PROJECT STRUCTURE & EXECUTION
- Ruby application resides in `Support/` directory
- All ruby related execution: `cd Support && bundle exec <command>`
- Run Ruby: `bundle exec ruby <file>`
- Run RSpec: `bundle exec rspec <spec_file>`
- Run IRB: `bundle exec irb`

## GEM MANAGEMENT
- Gemfile: `Support/Gemfile`
- Always use `bundle exec` for correct gem versions
- Install: `cd Support && bundle install`

## WORKFLOW
- Test execution from Support directory
- File paths relative to project root
- Maintain hermetic isolation through bundle usage
