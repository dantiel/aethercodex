# 🌌 HERMETIC PROJECT TODO

## 🏛️ CORE ARCHITECTURAL PILLARS (Language Agnostic)

### 🔮 AI INTEGRATION & REASONING
✔︎ AI Connection @done(27-07-2025 19:14)
✔︎ Reasoning-Model Tool Integration @done(12-08-2025 20:53)
✔︎ Add Reasoning Content @done(27-07-2025 19:11)

### 📁 FILE & MEMORY SYSTEMS
✔︎ Basic File Operations @done(27-07-2025 19:11)
✔︎ Mnemosyne Memory System @done(12-08-2025 20:52)
✔︎ File Overview & Symbolic Analysis @done(09-08-2025 13:51)
◯ improve symbolic analysis
◯ mnemosyne memory truncation should be longer, it has to be possible to retrieve complete memories, otherwise when creating memories that are too long there should be an error message
  
### 🛠️ TOOLING & COMMANDS
✔︎ Allow Safe Commands @done(27-07-2025 19:12)
✔︎ replace pygments by rouge @done(29-07-2025 23:52)
◯ add instrument: temp_create_file. this action creates a file for use as a temporary script or utility that isnt supposed to be part of the project but for the ai handling. it will be automatically cleaned up after termination or request.
◯ when the max tool calls commands are exceeded, instead of finishing the call, make a button that requires proceed so its not disrupted.
◯ make a (very short) overview  about last tools calls
◯ add a button to "pause" the current execution rather than stopping it, in in this state some arbitrary information and hints and additional requirements may be added by the user as prompt.
◯ stop button should also log the current output to history.
◯ allow edit of previous message to create new prompt and history starting point

### 🌐 UI & INTEGRATION
